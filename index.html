		<div class="content">
			<p>JD is an <strong>easy to use</strong> library <em>not a framework</em> made for those who would rather spend time writing beautiful HTML and CSS rather than trying to re-invent the wheel by putting some JavaScript together.</p>

			<p>This means every component can be activated and controlled via some simple (and valid) HTML attributes. <strong>Focus on what you do best</strong>: making your pages look nice.</p>

			<p>But wait! You can also use them via some regular JavaScript if you need (for example, if you load some of that HTML asynchronously).</p>

		<h3 class="title">Is it heavy?</h3>

		<div class="content">	
			<p>Short answer? No, it's super lightweight!</p>

			<p>First, <strong>each component can be used on its own</strong>, without having to load those you don't need. That way you control exactly what weight you add to your page.</p>

			<p>Also, this library is designed to use recent (dare I say <em>latest</em>?) technologies only, aimed at evergreen browsers. That means there is no compatibility-only code. Everything is <strong>standard and clean</strong>.</p>

		<div class="content">
			<p>JD loves taking care of people's needs.</p>

			<p>It can already create a clean and customizable <strong><a href="{{ '/docs/text-editor/' | prepend:site.baseurl | prepend:site.url }}">text editor</a></strong> for you!</p>
